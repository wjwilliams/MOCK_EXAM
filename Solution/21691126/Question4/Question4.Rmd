abstract: |
  Abstract to be written here. The abstract should not be too long and should provide the reader with a good understanding what you are writing about. Academic papers are not like novels where you keep the reader in suspense. To be effective in getting others to read your paper, be as open and concise about your findings here as possible. Ideally, upon reading your abstract, the reader should feel he / she must read your paper in entirety.

<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Lets load in example data, and see how this can be stored and later called from your 'data' folder.
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

```{r}
Lst <- 
    list.files("data/Tennis/", full.names = T) %>% 
    .[grepl("atp_matches", .)] %>% 
    # I don't want to look at doubles - cos Nadal no play double.
    .[!grepl("doubles", .)] %>% as.list()

# Join player info by id:
    playerinfo <-
        read_csv("data/Tennis/atp_players.csv") %>% select(player_id, hand, height)

    # The following function reads in the player information in a concise, silent manner.

# Introduction \label{Introduction}
We are interested in Nadal so my thought process is to subset the data to games that only Nadal has played in, from there we can use the same code (funtional coding is beautiful) to isolate other players to begin the comparison 
```{r}
tennis <- result_Large_events

games <- tennis %>% 
    filter(grepl("Rafael Nadal", winner_name)| grepl("Rafael Nadal", loser_name)) %>% mutate(result = ifelse(winner_name == "Rafael Nadal", "Win", "Loss")) %>% 
    mutate(opp_rank = ifelse(result == "Win", loser_rank, winner_rank)) %>% 
    mutate(player_type = ifelse(opp_rank <10, "Top 10", ifelse(opp_rank < 50, "Top 50", "Not Top"))) %>% filter(!is.na(player_type))

Wins <- 
    bind_rows(
    games %>% 
    summarise(win_perc = sum(result == "Win")/ n()) %>% 
    mutate(Type = "All"),
    
    games %>% 
        group_by(player_type) %>% 
        summarise(win_perc = sum(result == "Win")/ n()) %>% 
    rename(Type = player_type),
    
      games %>% 
        group_by(surface) %>% 
        summarise(win_perc = sum(result == "Win")/ n()) %>% 
    rename(Type = surface),
    
     games %>% 
        filter(tourney_level == c("G", "F", "M")) %>% 
        group_by(tourney_level) %>% 
    summarise(win_perc = sum(result == "Win")/ n()) %>% 
    rename(Type = tourney_level),
    
games %>%
  filter(tourney_level %in% c("G", "F", "M")) %>%
  group_by(tourney_level, surface) %>%
  summarise(win_perc = sum(result == "Win") / n()) %>%
  mutate(Type = glue("{tourney_level} & {surface}")) %>%
    ungroup() %>% 
  select(Type, win_perc),

games %>%
  group_by(player_type, surface) %>%
  summarise(win_perc = sum(result == "Win") / n()) %>%
  mutate(Type = glue("{player_type} & {surface}")) %>%
    ungroup() %>%

    )

 
 wins_clay <- Wins %>%

     arrange(win_perc) %>%

     geom_bar(aes(x = Type, y= win_perc, fill = Type), stat = "identity")
 
 wins_grass <- Wins %>%
